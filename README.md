# iLife-Die
No more dice, no more writing down each others scores, keeping track of HP in your head, trying to calculate how much health you lost. You should be having fun not worrying about anything else.

iLive Count has what you need without overthinking the process. Simply keep tracy of your health without the increment buttons and keep your game going. With the increment buttons, you’re able to remove or add health with precision so there isn’t a chance your hand will slip and mess up the scores.

Ready to start over? Good, hit reset, set the score back to 20 and play again.
